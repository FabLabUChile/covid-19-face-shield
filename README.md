# Resume

Based on the [Prusa Face Shield](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-protective-face-shield-rc3) initiative, the idea of this design is to eliminate any process on the parts, decreasing the chance of contamination during the fabrication process and for direct assembly. This design consist in a single printed piece, a clear sheet and a rubber band.

# Commercial Parts

The rubber band and the clear sheet are commercial parts. The sheet is a cellulose acetate clear sheet, letter size (220X280 mm), 0.2 mm thick, you can get some in almost any library or school supply store. You can use any rubber band as long you feel comfortable with it, we used the most popular around here, [the money rubber band](https://envato-shoebox-0.imgix.net/6ef5/6284-fc6f-11e2-9f2a-842b2b692e1a/Dollar+bills+tied+with+a+rubber+band.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&mark=https%3A%2F%2Felements-assets.envato.com%2Fstatic%2Fwatermark2.png&markalign=center%2Cmiddle&markalpha=18&w=700&s=1d7993257e4dcf2818c1a83303ead3cc).

# Headband

We printed the headband in PLA, as is easier to print, available, has a low carbon footprint and it is tough enough. You can use a stronger filament if you want, like ABS or PETG, as long it is compatible with the sanitation measures that will be used on it.

The headband consist in two strips joint togheter in the ends. The inner strip goes around the head and the outer strip holds the clear sheet far from the face to allow some room for glasses. The ends of the headband have a hook to mount the rubber band.
