# Resume

Based on the [Prusa Face Shield](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-protective-face-shield-rc3) initiative, the idea of this design is to eliminate any further work on the parts, decreasing the chance of contamination during the fabrication stage and for direct assembly. The face shield is meant to be used complementary with a N95 facial mask and goggles, adding more protection to the medical staff and extending the available time period of the N95 mask between sanitations.

# Parts

The device consists of three components: A 3D printed headband, a clear cellulose acetate sheet and a rubber band.

## Commercial Parts

The rubber band and the clear sheet are commercial parts. The sheet is a cellulose acetate clear sheet, letter size (220X280 mm), 0.2 mm thick, you can get some in almost any library or school supply store. It is possible to use a clear sheet of other material if it is available in the same size and if it is compatible with the available sanitation methods. You can use any rubber band as long you feel comfortable with it, we used the most popular around here, [the money rubber band](https://envato-shoebox-0.imgix.net/6ef5/6284-fc6f-11e2-9f2a-842b2b692e1a/Dollar+bills+tied+with+a+rubber+band.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=max&mark=https%3A%2F%2Felements-assets.envato.com%2Fstatic%2Fwatermark2.png&markalign=center%2Cmiddle&markalpha=18&w=700&s=1d7993257e4dcf2818c1a83303ead3cc).

## Printed Headband

We printed the headband in PLA, as is easier to print, available, , compostable, has a low carbon footprint and it is tough enough. You can use a stronger filament if you want, like ABS or PETG, as long it is compatible with the sanitation measures that will be used on it.

The headband consist in two strips joint togheter in the ends. The inner strip goes around the head and the outer strip holds the clear sheet with some slip fits, far from the face to allow some room for glasses or goggles, also to avoid some fogging in the sheet due to breathing. The ends of the headband have a hook to mount the rubber band.

### Printer Settings 

#### Part deployment on Cura, slip fits upward

![asd2](/images/curaset.png "Part deployment on Cura")

We used some Ender 3 and Ender 5 3D printers to make the prototype and Cura as slicer, no special settings:

- Material: PLA
- Extruder Temp: 200°C
- Bed Temp: 60°C
- Layer Height: 0.3 mm
- Number of Shells: 3
- Infill density: 30%
- Speed: 60 mm/s infill, 30 mm/s walls.

The part must be handled with care, using clean gloves and mask to avoid contamination, and quickly stored in a plastic bag as soon it cools down after printing. [Recent studies](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_home) had revealed that the virus can last until 90 hours in plastic surfaces, so the headbands must be stored three or four days before delivery, unless the proper hygiene and sanitation protocols are being taken. 

# Assembly

After printing and sanitation of the parts, introduce the sheet in the fits of the headband in the outer strip as the picture below shows. Then, hook the rubber band in the headband ends. Ensure that the sheet is firm by pulling it gently. This is fundamental as otherwhise the user will be in danger of infection.

#### Putting the sheet into the slip fits

# Usage

Once the user is fully equiped with other protection measures, the inner band of the faceshield is put against the forehead, and then, the rubber band is pulled down to the back of the head.
